### Modbus Tools and USB/RS485 Converter Driver: (Software)
* Modbus Tools source: https://www.modbustools.com/ (only 30-day trials)
* ModbusPoll: install on PC to read the devices in the network via RS485 or LAN.
* ModbusSlave: install on PC to simulate a device with Modbus Protocols (Modbus/RTU, TCP)
* Modbustool.7z: executable file (.exe), unlimited time to use, but Chinese GUI only
* ModbusTool(English): A free suite containing both Modbus Master and Slave programs (https://github.com/ClassicDIY/ModbusTool)
* USB/RS485 converter driver CH340 (source:https://www.wch.cn/download/CH341SER_EXE.html )
* RealTerm: A powerful serial terminal program
### Hands-ON Instruction: 
#### 1. Install the software and connect the device
1. Download and install the Modbus tools.
2. Plug in the USB/RS485 converter (install the USB/RS485 converter driver, CH340 if necessary)
#### (Optional) Test the converters by connecting one to each end of the communication cable.

1. Connect the black conductor to A and the white conductor to B in the USB/RS485 converters' terminals.
2. Connect each converter to the computer. Two free USB ports are necessary.
3. Open two Realterm instances and configure each with the appropriate COM port set by the OS.
4. If the terminals and converters are configured correctly when text is typed in one terminal,
5. It should appear inside the other. Remember to close the RealTerm programs after use, as they will interfere with other programs that will use the converters.
#### 2. First PC-to-PC
1. Configure ModbusSlave on PC#1 for creating registers data
2. Use PC#2 with ModbusPoll to read the data from PC#1
#### 3. PC-to-PowerMeter
1. Use read power meter voltage and current by PC with ModbusPoll
#### 4. Read data of both humi-temp sensor and powermeter
0. Change device ID (default ID =1)
    - Change Temp/Humi (manual)
    - Change Powermeter (manual)
2. wiring and setting (ID:1 Humi-temp sensor, ID:2 Power Meter); Manual can be found in "device_manual," 溫濕度計 and Peacefair電表)
